# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised all the concepts, completed two exercises on pandas.

**Thoughts:** I tried to remember whatever I had studied from before, and I could understand pandas and completed the exercise successfully.

### Day 1: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas Visualisation, Plotly, Cufflinks, Chloropleth Geographical Maps and did 30% of 911 Calls project

**Thoughts:** I went overboard and did only coding for an entire day. It seemed to pay dividends as I could complete the entire Data Science part of the course in just 2 days.

### Day 2: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did about 10% of the 911 Calls project.
**Thoughts:** Neck was hurting really badly, so couldn't concentrate much.

### Day 3: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed 911 project, did about 25% of the finance project

**Thoughts:** Getting a better understanding of how we need to logically extract data, different sources for stock indicators etc. I had to go through solutions multiple times but I am learning through this.
