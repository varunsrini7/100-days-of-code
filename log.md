# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revised all the concepts, completed two exercises on pandas.

**Thoughts:** I tried to remember whatever I had studied from before, and I could understand pandas and completed the exercise successfully.

### Day 1: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas Visualisation, Plotly, Cufflinks, Chloropleth Geographical Maps and did 30% of 911 Calls project

**Thoughts:** I went overboard and did only coding for an entire day. It seemed to pay dividends as I could complete the entire Data Science part of the course in just 2 days.

### Day 2: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did about 10% of the 911 Calls project.
**Thoughts:** Neck was hurting really badly, so couldn't concentrate much.

### Day 3: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed 911 project, did about 25% of the finance project

**Thoughts:** Getting a better understanding of how we need to logically extract data, different sources for stock indicators etc. I had to go through solutions multiple times but I am learning through this.

### Day 4 : February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Finance project, started ML part of the course, did 50% part of Linear Regression Model

**Thoughts:** Finance project should probably be revisited multiple times since it's a little hard to remember. Learnt the basis for doing ML; knowledge from Econometric Methods helped me get through the basic lectures fast.

### Day 5 : February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Linear Regression fully and also completed Logistic Regression fully

**Thoughts:** I learnt the basis for Linear and Logistic regression, things are starting to make more sense. Also, able to remember more codes without looking for any reference. Seems like I need to start reading ISLR on the side.

### Day 6 : February 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed KNN

**Thoughts:** Finished the project, seems like I need to read ISLR on an urgent basis to get the mathematical hang of what's going on

### Day 7 : February 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Decision Trees and Random Forests

**Thoughts:** understood how it works, although having a problem with fitting the data properly with all .fit() conditions, have to take care of that asap as my data results are fully wrong!

### Day 8 : February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Support Vector Machines

**Thoughts:** Just learnt the concept briefly and syntax for it.

### Day 9 : February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed K means clustering

**Thoughts:** understood how it works, but since I was tired due to travel, I could not complete more than this today.

### Day 10 : February 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Principal Component Analysis

### Day 11 : February 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read a bit of ISLR

### Day 12 : February 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started Deep Learning

**Thoughts:** Learnt the fundamentals of Neural Networks and some other important terms

### Day 13 : February 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued Deep Learning exercises

### Day 14 : February 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started NLP

### Day 15 : March 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed Recommender Systems

### Day 16 : March 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started final project on Deep Learning


### Day 17 : March 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed about 80%  of the Deep Learning Project, skipped the remaining big data part. Completed the course and got the certification. Midsem break for 100-days-of-code challenge. Will resume on 17th March.
